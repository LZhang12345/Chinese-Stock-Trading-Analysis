We start by web scraping the table from url: http://fund.eastmoney.com/data/fundranking.html#tall;c0;r;sqjzf;pn50;ddesc;qsd20150101;qed20151231;qdii;zq;gg;gzbd;gzfs;bbzt;sfbb <br>
Unlike the normal procedures, this html contains "dynamic" contents. Therefore, we need to do more than directly scraping.
